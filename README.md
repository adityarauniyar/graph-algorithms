# graph-algorithms
Graph related algorithms with corner test cases and stress testing for few. 
- Problem statement is well defines under each file with type of input params, constraints and output types. 

Top Graph-algorithms include:
- Kruskal (Cluster formation)
- Prim 
- Floyd Warshall 
- BFS
- DFS
- -ve cycle detection
- Dijkstra
- Bidirectional Dijkstra 
- A*
- Bidirectional A*
- Contraction hierarchies

Report for any bug.
